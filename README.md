## 4. Features :

It holds two Design projects. Both have their indiviual resources except the images and videos folder.  
Here is the Short Description of both the projects:  
1. **Written in pure HTML and CSS that hols the files *index.html* and *style.css* :**  
This Page is not responsive it is only compatible the large screen sizes because I have not used *Media Query* that I will do in future Projects.   
1. **Used Bootstrap for the Designing that hols the files *bootstrap.html* and *bootstrap.css* :**   
This Page is fully responsive for all kinds of the screens.  
I used following bootstrap classes for the Designing and Resposiveness:
- **.navbar** - *for responsive collapsing.*
- **.navbar-toggler** - *for use with our collapse plugin and other navigation toggling behaviors.*
- **.collapse .navbar-collapse** - *for grouping and hiding navbar contents by a parent breakpoint.*
- **.navbar-nav** - *for a full-height and lightweight navigation (including support for dropdowns).*
- **.active** - *to indicate the current page.*
- **.nav-link** - *to indicate the Navigation link*
- **.d-flex** - *to implement display flex property and other flexbox property like justify content, flex direction and align items etc.*
- **.m** - *for applying margin to the element.*
- **.p** - *for applying padding to the element.*
- **.fs-#** - *for changing the Font size based on the requirment scale from 1-6*

*These Projects are only a demo of the Netflix Home page that holds the same design pattern as Netflix has like Sliders, Hover and Transition effects.*  
*For the icons I use use font awesome. After successful login, create your kit and use it in head tag. link here for visit :- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)*  

**NOTE :** *Both Design pages shares the same Assets folder **images** and **videos**.*
